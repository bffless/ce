name: Cleanup old container images

# WARNING: Do NOT add delete-only-untagged-versions jobs!
# Multi-arch images (buildx) store platform-specific manifests as "untagged" versions.
# Deleting untagged versions breaks the OCI index references and corrupts the images.
# See: https://github.com/actions/delete-package-versions/issues/90
